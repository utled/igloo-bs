# IDEAS FOR WHERE THIS IS GOING

- Feature to copy remote file/dir to local machine
  - Record Inode of origin file
  - Use some form of temp dir for storing
  - Set up monitoring for that temp dir, on change: propose save to remote system
  - Use Rsync for entry transfers
  - Should this program install rsync if not already installed, or be part of the independent setup with ssh access?
